**数据集优势:** 

This dataset has 15,150 images from 12 different classes of household garbage; paper, cardboard, biological, metal, plastic, green-glass, brown-glass, white-glass, clothes, shoes, batteries, and trash.

Garbage Recycling is a key aspect of preserving our environment. To make the recycling process possible/easier, the garbage must be sorted to groups that have similar recycling process. I found that most available data sets classify garbage into a few classes (2 to 6 classes at most). Having the ability to sort the household garbage into more classes can result in dramatically increasing the percentage of the recycled garbage.
